Fullstack Software Developer focused on Java, Spring Boot, SQL, and Docker, combined with solid experience in UI/UX Design. My background in Product Design and my history as a graphic designer enhance my ability to create clear, intuitive, and user-centered solutions.

I work on the development of a digital academic platform, performing the functions of Requirements Analyst and Screen Designer (UX/UI), conducting functional requirements gathering, flow modeling, prototyping, and creating efficient interfaces aligned with user needs and system architecture.

In parallel, I develop automations using n8n and Docker, creating workflows that optimize routines, control rework, and increase operational scalability. I am driven by continuous learning and the integration between technology, design, and automation.
